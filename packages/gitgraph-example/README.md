# Giterm Git Graph Render Library

A simple react web project to allow easy development and testing of the giterm graph

## Getting started

Commands:

* `yarn start`: runs the app for manual testing and development
* `yarn test`: runs the test suite

For manual test cases two files are provided:

* `data.js` contains a complete repository's history for a realistic test case
* `data-test.js` contains a series of tests, including a `TestGitBuilder` instance, which is useful for playing around. With the app running, navigate to `/test` to view this data
